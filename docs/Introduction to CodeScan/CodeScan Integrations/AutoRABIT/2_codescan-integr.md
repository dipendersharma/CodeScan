### CodeScan SCA Results:


During the implementation phase of a Security Development Lifecycle (SDL), [Static Code Analysis](https://www.autorabit.com/products/codescan/){target="_blank"} is usually performed as part of a Code Review.

* CodeScan being a Static Analysis tool continuously detects and reports on data flow problems, software defects, language implementation errors, inconsistencies, dangerous usage, coding standard violations, and security vulnerabilities.

* AutoRABIT generates a detailed SCA Result report and the Lint runs by default every time you run a [static code analysis](https://knowledgebase.autorabit.com/docs/static-code-analysis). Lint analyzes source code to flag programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors, and suspicious constructs.

* Lint Report will only display information about AuraBundle components.

These reports will have information about the files that were reviewed and its related violations.

* Click on each file to view its related violations that will appear at the bottom right side of the page.

* If you click on any violation, it will take you to the respective line (in the black screen on the right side) where such violation occurred.

* Click on the **link** at the bottom of the page as in the image below which will redirect you to CodeScan Analysis Dashboard page to compare the SCA report in your CodeScan account.
