We are happy to announce our partnership with Copado.

**Copado** is a release management tool for the Salesforce platform. Copado users can now integrate [CodeScan](https://knowledgebase.autorabit.com/codescan/docs/codescan) in their deployments to achieve error-free and secure releases.

If you have been wondering on how to integrate your [CodeScan](https://www.codescan.io/){target="_blank"} account with Copado, we have a step by step guide which helps you do it and it will be the beginning of your static analysis using CodeScan way on Copado. 

Click [here](https://docs.copado.com/article/ehy5j4f8e5-code-scan-sca-settings){target="_blank"} to access the documentation required to follow step by step procedure on how to integrate it.

Once the integration is completed, whenever you run a [static code analysis](https://www.codescan.io/blog/static-code-analysis-tools-for-salesforce/){target="_blank"} from a User Story or an Org Credential record associated to an environment inside this pipeline, it will take these SCA settings and will create a new [Static Code Analysis Results](https://docs.copado.com/article/e5b2qany3u-code-scan-sca-results){target="_blank"} record with the scan details and a link to the CodeScan results.
