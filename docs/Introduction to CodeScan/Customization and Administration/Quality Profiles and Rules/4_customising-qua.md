Quality Profiles determine the list of rules used in a scan. Quality Profiles can be customised by adding and removing rules, setting severities, and changing scope where applicable.

To make a custom Quality Profile you can create a new profile or by copying one of our default profiles from the list as a starting point.   
:::(Info) (Note:)
Changes CAN NOT be made to the default profiles, only to custom profiles. If you are using a default profile and would like to remove a rule, please make a copy of the default profile and make your changes to the copied profle.

To costomise the Quality Profile, follow the steps below:
1. First, access the **Quality profile** menu from the organisation home page.
