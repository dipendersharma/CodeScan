There are two ways to add new members to your CodeScan Cloud organisation: 

* First one is, if user has already signed up to CodeScan Cloud
* Second, if user has not signed up to CodeScan Cloud

If the user has **already signed up** to CodeScan Cloud, they will need to be added to the organisation by an administrator. In this case, the steps to add members are as follows.
