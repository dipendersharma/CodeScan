<h2>CodeScan 4.5</h2><h3>New Features</h3><p><strong>New Cloud Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Native GitLab Integration</strong>: Your GitLab cloud repo's are now just one click away from our new GUI integration.</li><li><strong>Verbose Billing Warnings</strong>: Billing warnings will now be more verbose.</li></ul><p><strong>New Apex Rules</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Avoid using null conditions in SOQL WHERE clause:</strong> by default, index tables do not include null records. WHERE clauses that include nulls will therefore require a full scan, which can be very slow for large data volumes. The developer must determine if a fix is needed.</li><li><strong>Page Action with a simple redirection</strong>: avoid creating a page action that makes a simple client side redirect.</li><li><strong>Sending outbound emails using Messaging.sendEmail</strong>: emails sent with Messaging.sendEmail count against daily limits which can cause rejection. The developer must determine if a fix is needed.</li><li><strong>Using Batch Apex from a trigger is dangerous</strong>: ensure that jobs created by the trigger do not exceed job limit.</li><li><strong>Using Database.AllowCallouts interface in Batch Apex</strong>: it is not recommended to make HTTP calls as part of Batch Apex logic.</li><li><strong>Source files should have a sufficient density of comment lines (v4.5.3)</strong>: this version of the rule is able to be used in the IDE. An issue is created on a file as soon as the density of comment lines on this file is less than the required threshold.</li></ul><h3>Enhancements</h3><ul><li>DMLWithoutSharingEnabled now takes Inheritance into account (<strong>v4.5.2</strong>).</li><li>FieldLevelSecurity now has a parameter to check classes that extend system level classes ie.
