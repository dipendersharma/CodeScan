This article will help get you started with [CodeScan Cloud](https://www.codescan.io/products/cloud/). The video above will run you through the process of signing up and creating your first project. See below for links and a more in-depth look at the configuration.

There are 3 steps to getting CodeScan Cloud working for you.

1.  **Defining your Standards**
2.  **Achieving Visibility**
3.  **Enforcing your standards**

In each section below are links to articles to help you set up CodeScan through these three steps.  

Defining your Standards
-----------------------

CodeScan comes out-of-the-box with some predefined rule sets. These represent our recommended minimums for your security and quality.

However, these rule sets are completely customizable. Define what you would like to see and how important it is by creating your own custom rule sets. [Click here to learn how customizable rule](https://knowledgebase.autorabit.com/codescan/docs/customising-quality-profiles).

Defining a level of quality that is expected is also very important. The highest level quality indicator of your code is a hard pass or fail. [Click here to learn how to set these standards](https://knowledgebase.autorabit.com/codescan/docs/customising-quality-profiles).

Achieving Visibility
--------------------

CodeScan helps you keep your code clean as you develop with the use of the branching functionality and new code periods.

Being able to see the issues as they appear allows you to maintain your standards on current development and plan your refactoring effort. See here for more information on [Branching Functionality](https://knowledgebase.autorabit.com/codescan/docs/understanding-branches-in-codescan-cloud) and the [New Code Period](https://knowledgebase.autorabit.com/codescan/docs/understanding-the-new-code-period).

Enforcing your standards
------------------------

Passing or failing a project on the CodeScan dashboard is useful and using those metrics to enforce your standards is the next step. [Learn how CodeScan can be integrated into your repository or pipeline with our articles around CI/CD](https://knowledgebase.autorabit.com/codescan/docs/codescan-integrations)
