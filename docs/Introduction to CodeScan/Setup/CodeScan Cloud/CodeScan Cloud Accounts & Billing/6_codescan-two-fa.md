CodeScan provides you with 2FA for your account privacy and security.  This document helps you understand how to setup and work with 2FA.
:::(Info) (Note:)
If you are setting up a 2FA, make sure that you are saving the token generated carefully as it allows you to reset the 2FA if you have trouble logging in or getting push notifications.
