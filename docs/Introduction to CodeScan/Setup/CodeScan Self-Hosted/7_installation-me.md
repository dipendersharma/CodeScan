### Installation Methods
This guide will get a **fully functional evaluation version** of the enterprise CodeScan running on your own server.

### Installing CodeScan
There are two ways of getting CodeScan running:

* **Cloud**: CodeScan offers CodeScan Cloud, a hosted solution on the Cloud. Learn more about participating in the CodeScan Cloud [[here](https://www.codescan.io/products/cloud/){target="_blank"}].
* **[Self Hosted](https://www.codescan.io/products/self-hosted/){target="_blank"}:** This method will guide you through a full install. It takes a bit longer time to install and requires a bit more skills.

To install the CodeScan, go to our [installation instructions page](https://knowledgebase.autorabit.com/codescan/docs/installing-codescan-self-hosted){target="_blank"}.
