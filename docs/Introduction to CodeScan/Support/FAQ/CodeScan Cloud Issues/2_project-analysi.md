Errors such as **Expired Token** on your Project Analysis page can sometimes be fixed by resetting the link to your code repository. 

[CodeScan Cloud](https://www.codescan.io/products/cloud/){target="_blank"} allows you to do this **without erasing** the historical data present in your project.

To fix the above errors, first you need to delete the **Analysis Project**, to delete follow the steps below:

1. Open your project and navigate to the **Administration > Project Analysis** page.
