The **ip restricted** issue can be solved by relaxing the ip restrictions for the CodeScan connected app in the org you are trying to scan. 

To do this follow the below steps:

1. Log in to the org you are trying to scan.
2. Go to **Setup** and search for **Connected Apps OAuth Usage**.
3. Install the app that is making the scan (*CodeScan Cloud* or *CodeScan Quick Reports*).
4. Click **Manage App Policies** and then **Edit Policies**.
5. Under **IP Relaxation** select **Relax IP Restrictions**.
6. Re-Run the scan.
