A CodeScan Cloud Organisation is a collection of projects, users and configurations used to customise CodeScan Cloud for your purposes.

When signing up to CodeScan Cloud, an Organisation is created automatically under your user name. New organisations can be created at any time using the '**+**' icon at the top left of the screen.

When using the Invite User feature to add a new user to the system, the user will be signed up and added to your Organisation without having their own created.

Your billing is also linked to your organisation and applies to all projects within that organisation.

If you have any further questions about CodeScan Cloud Organisations, please contact our support team at [support@codescan.io](http://support@codescan.io){target="_blank"}
