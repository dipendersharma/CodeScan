Security reports allow you to get an overview of possible vulnerable areas in your code determined by **OWASP**, **CWE** and **SANS** guidelines.

These ratings are based on Vulnerability rules and Security Hotspots in your quality profiles that have an OWASP category attributed to them. 

**Vulnerabilities** are based on code that is open to an attack whereas the **Security Hotspots** highlight areas of your code that should be reviewed by a security auditor. 

Hotspots are dealt with slightly differently than vulnerabilities. Once they have been reviewed, they can be marked as **Clear** or **Detect**

Detecting an issue will mark it as a **Vulnerability** (a confirmed problem) and allows it to be assigned to a user.

Once an issue has been checked by a user it can either be **Dismissed** (requiring more information from the security reviewer) or **fixed** and have a review requested.

Dismissing an issue reverts it back to a security hotspot whereas **Request Review** marks this issue as fixed and adds is to the review column in your Security report under **Security Hotspots**.
